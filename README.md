# DnD 5etools DM Screen Encounter Display

This tool allows you to have a displayable version for encounters tracked on [5etools DM Screen](https://5e.tools/dmscreen.html).

Using 5etools' sources, you will be able to have the page display information form the encounter, such as:
- Current Round
- Initiative order
- Exact HP of each PC
- Exact HP of each monster OR a healthbar which changes corresponding to the monster's current HP, but not showing exact values
- Pictures for each combatant (PC and monsters)
